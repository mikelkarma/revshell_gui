## Description
This Python script is a simple Flask application designed to act as a server for handling client connections and messages. It provides functionality for user authentication, listing connected clients, sending messages to specific clients, and logging server activities.

## Dependencies
- Flask
- Threading
- Socket
- JSON
- Queue

## Usage
1. Run the Flask application by executing the `app.py` script.
2. Access the server through a web browser or an API client.
3. Perform login to authenticate yourself.
4. Start the server by providing a host and port.
5. List connected clients to see their IDs and addresses.
6. Send messages to specific clients either with or without waiting for their response.
7. Logout to end the session.

## Endpoints
- `/start_server`: POST method to start the server.
- `/list_connections`: GET method to list connected clients.
- `/login`: GET method to render the login page, POST method to authenticate users.
- `/send_message`: POST method to send messages to clients.
- `/send_message_and_wait`: POST method to send messages to clients and wait for their response.
- `/logout`: GET method to logout the user.
- `/`: GET method to render the home page.
- `/get_logs`: GET method to retrieve server logs.

## Security
- User authentication is required to access most endpoints.
- Passwords are stored in a JSON file (`users.json`) and compared during login.

## Logging
- Server activities are logged and displayed on the home page.
- Only the last 50 log entries are kept in memory to prevent excessive resource usage.

## Note
- This is a basic implementation and may not be suitable for production use without further security and performance enhancements.
